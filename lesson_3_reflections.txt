When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You might do this when you want to collaborate with others, or make your work public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may make changes remotely which you don't want to work on locally.
Also, if you have a public repository you may not want to automatically incorporate 3rd party changes locally.
