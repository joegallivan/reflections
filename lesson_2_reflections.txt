What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialise a repository, you set up a directory which Git can use to keep track of the files you want it to.
You need to do this so Git knows what you want to include - after you tell it explicitly.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area works between the working directory and the repository.
It provides a space in which to gather the documents you want to include in a single commit.
